# ESP8266-WIFI-Humidity-Monitor
Wireless humidity Monitor for my 3D printer filament. Samples DHT 11 every X hours/days, sends it to IFTTT and goes back in to deep sleep.

### Other Random notes so future me has a clue what I did here:
Some code borrowed from: https://github.com/beamzer/Wemos-IFTTT-Button/blob/master/Wemos-IFTTT-Button/Wemos-IFTTT-Button.ino
Another cool version: https://nobugsjustfeatures.wordpress.com/2017/12/11/pir-sensor-alarm-with-esp8266-and-ifttt-webhooks-maker/

Yes some variables are no longer used and should be removed. That is a future person problem- deal with it.
Yes credentials are hard coded- I did this to expressly annoy the internutz. Life is about joy in little wins....

GPIO16 must be tied to reset to wake!

March 2020
Added backup of working library for my ESP12E- All other DHT libraries fail.  Seemingly impossible to find the working one again.  Found it here:
